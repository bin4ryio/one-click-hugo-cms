The Midasium Blockchain is a global shared distributed ledger system for securely executing and recording real estate financial transactions over the internet. It is a decentralised network such that no single entity controls or owns the system. Instead of a centralised control structure, it is managed by consortium of accredited business entities that comply with the built-in protocol of the network.
